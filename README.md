## Executing
(Optional if you already have a lua executor)
- Get a lua executor. I recommend this one : https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=19002 
- Inject the dll into Gmod (Recommended 32bit!)
- Make a folder called "external" in your documents folder
- Put the script in said folder
- In console type "external PropWare_0.37.lua"

## Usage
Using it is simple, Just type in a custom prop model (find one by right clicking any prop in the Q-Menu then clicking copy) and just paste it in the text box and then click spawn, or you can use a pre-selected prop.

## Features
- Custom delay between prop spawns
- Custom amount of any prop to spawn
- Choose from the pre-selected props if your lazy
- Spawn all the pre-selected props for fun
- Clear all props
