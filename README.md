## Notice
I  am going to likely add alot more feutures soon.
You can skid my shit code idc :)

## Usage 
You will need a lua executor to use this, I recommend this one : https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=19002
After downloading external.dll from above inject it (32bit) into gmod and make a folder called "external" in your documents folder and put the script in there, then via console type "external PropWare_0.37.lua"
Or execute it using your own lua executor

Using it is simple,Just type in a custom prop model (find one by right clicking any prop in the Q-Menu then clicking copy) and just paste it in the text box and click spawn. 

## Feutures

- Custom delay between prop spawns
- Custom amount of any prop to spawn
- Choose from the pre-selected props if your lazy
- Spawn all the pre-selected props for fun
- Clear all props
