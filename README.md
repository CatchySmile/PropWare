## Notice
I  am going to likely add alot more feutures soon.
You can skid my shit code idc :)

**Looking into re-making alot of the script and adding a darkRP Bypass of sorts**

## Executing
(Optional if you already have a lua executor)
- Get a lua executor. I recommend this one : https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=19002 
- Inject the dll into Gmod (The one provided is only for 32bit!)
- Make a folder called "external" in your documents folder
- Put the script in said folder
- In console type "external PropWare_0.41.lua"

## Usage
Using it is simple, Just type in a custom prop model (find one by right clicking any prop in the Q-Menu then clicking copy) and just paste it in the text box and then click spawn, or you can use a pre-selected prop.

## Features
